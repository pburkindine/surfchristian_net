Here, <a style="color: black;" href="tripping-daisy_jesus-hits-like-the-atom-bomb.zip" target="_blank" name="">the beginning of the book of John</a>, which is essential to understanding what we're trying to tell you:<br/><br/>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 34px; font-size: smaller;">
In the beginning was the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Word</span> (Logos), and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Word</span> (Logos) was with <span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span>, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Word</span> was <span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span>.<br/><br/>

<span style="font-variant: small-caps">He</span> (Logos) was in the beginning with <span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span>.<br/><br/>

Through <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Logos</span> all things were made; without <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Logos</span> nothing was made that has been made.<br/><br/>


In that same was life itself, and that life was the light of men.<br/>
The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. (?? !! ??)<br/><br/>

There came a man who was sent from <span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span>; his name was John the Baptist.<br/>
He came as a witness to testify concerning that light,<br/> so that through him all men might believe.<br/>
He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.<br/>
The true light that gives light to every man "was coming into the world"...<br/><br/>

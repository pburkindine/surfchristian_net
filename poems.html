Like fire that knows your name.

      One of my faves, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Temptation-Christ-Willem-Dafoe/dp/B005F3VLZA" target="_blank"><img src="prime.png" style="height: 25px; width: auto;" /> The Last Temptation of Christ</a> is a fictional account by Nikos Kazantzakis dramatizing the moment on the Cross just before the Consummatum.
      <br /><br />

      Christ in his delirium imagines a life with a wife and children, before God calls Him again to the Cross, to Calvary.<br/><br/>

      When Christ says <strong>“IT. IS. ACCOMPLISHED!! 😆”</strong> in <em>The Last Temptation of Christ</em> — it’s not relief.<br/><br/>

      It’s not sadness.  It’s not even closure or achievement.<br><br>

      It’s a <strong>FULL-BODY GUFFAW, A FULL-THROTTLE DETONATION</strong> of his reason d'etre, his soul.<br><br>

      Not even “I've done it!," but:
      <strong>“OH HOLY WOW-A-MOLIE! — GOD IS HERE!”</strong><br><br>


      <!-- He <strong>exhales a spiritual SCRAW!/laugh! so wide it could wrap up the sun and moon</strong>.<br><br> -->


      The veil doesn’t tear because of nails.<br/>
      The veil tears because the **Word rips back through the atmosphere and says YES.**<br><br>

      <strong>IT. IS. ACCOMPLISHED!! ❤️ 😆 ✝️🕊️</strong>
      A rumbling bass note so deep, a laugh so raw, it's literally still happening!
